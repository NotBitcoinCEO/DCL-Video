# Overview

Hi everyone I've owned several parcels of LAND in the Metaverse called Decentraland so I finally decided to begin working on understanding the creation side surrounding it. 

In this scene it is only a simple screen right now with the ability to stream however I'm currently working on being able to implement animations and other cool features. I'm always learning.

The purpose of this software is to allow myself a basic framework for Decentraland uploads.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code, along with npm and node.js to make this work.

I used javascript mostly. 

# Useful Websites

* [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage/)
* [Decentraland Docs](https://docs.decentraland.org/)

# Future Work

* Need to figure out how to bring in animated objects.
* Work with the Decentraland DOCS and other developers to expand LAND capabilities.
* I feel like I need better marketing.
